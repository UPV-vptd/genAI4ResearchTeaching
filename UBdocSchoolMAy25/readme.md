To download files from GitHub, there are two primary methods:

Download the entire repository as a ZIP file from the repository's main page.

Download individual files using the file viewer (click on the file name to preview it)

There is no direct option to download a single folder (though there is a workaround involving modifying the access URL).

To get the following small size folder from a huge  repo: [https://github.com/jamg-upv/LLMforSLRscreening/edit/main/UBdocSchoolMAy25](https://github.com/jamg-upv/LLMforSLRscreening/edit/main/UBdocSchoolMAy25)

Just change only the github.com part of the URL to githubbox.com 

[https://githubbox.com/jamg-upv/LLMforSLRscreening/edit/main/UBdocSchoolMAy25](https://githubbox.com/jamg-upv/LLMforSLRscreening/edit/main/UBdocSchoolMAy25)
